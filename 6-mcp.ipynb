    "# Evolution of agents - MCP\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open spec that standardizes how AI clients (agents, IDEs, chat apps) discover and call external tools and access resources. It uses a clientâ€“server model where servers expose capabilities (tools/functions, prompts, resources like files/DBs) over JSON-RPC transports (e.g., stdio, WebSocket). The goal is portability and safety: tools are reusable across different LLM runtimes with consistent schemas, auth, and streaming I/O, while remaining sandboxed. In practice, you run an MCP server for a service and any MCP-compatible client can list its capabilities and invoke them.\n",
