    "This notebook explores more advanced agent tooling, including SQL-like queries and smarter plugins. It demonstrates how agents can leverage structured data access (e.g., DuckDB, pandas) and more complex toolchains to solve richer tasks. The focus is on building agents that can reason with external data and orchestrate multiple tools."
